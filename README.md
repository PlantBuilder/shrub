I'm [cha0s](https://github.com/cha0s) and I love real-time interactive web
applications.

## What's Angular Shrub?

Angular Shrub is intended to take Angular Seed to the next level. It includes
a server as well as the client application.

### Features

* Scalable (thanks to [Redis](http://redis.io)) real-time client/server
communication using [socket.io](http://socket.io)

* Clean and intelligent structure for the common AngularJS patterns
(controllers, directives, filters, and services)

* Numerous built-in tasks for [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), for seamless
integration of CoffeeScript, LESS, minification, and preprocessing to keep the
boilerplate away.

* Browser-side NodeJS-style modules, with a require service provided in
Angular for loading them.

* Foundational directives and services, such as notifications, navigation,
configuration, debugging, and more.

* Robust system for mocking every aspect of your application, including during
E2E tests, which Angular is a bit difficult about, out of the box.

## Get rolling

* Get yourself a clone: `$ git clone git://github.com/cha0s/angular-shrub.git`

* Get in the new directory and then `$ scripts/good-to-go`. This script will
return 0 if the project builds, and the tests run successfully. In other
words, you can easily wire it up in a pre-commit hook.
